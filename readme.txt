I have use the standard code provided and have added the methods DeleteVertex(), get1RingSize(), getNeighbours() and fillQueue(). All of them are in the file GeometricSurfaceDirectedEdge.cpp

Also, I have made modifications to the file GeometricController.cpp to be able to modify the code for the slider to work as intended removing a percentage of the vertices of the mesh and updating the neighbourhood size of the vertices after each removal.

Compile:

To compile execute ./compile.sh it is a file I created to execute all the commands to compile

To execute the compiled files use: ./nameFolder ./diredgenormals/fileName.diredgenormal
